# Donzel
Planning / Launchpad for Donzel API

## Reasoning
Maintainers of OSS have a lot on their heads whether it be keeping a healthy work/life balance, triaging issues, reviewing pull requests, writing code, deploying, shipping, promoting, and the list goes on.
There is no reason they should also have to spend so much of the precious resources that are time, energy, brain power, ect on dealing with whatever can be automated.

The purpose of this api is to provide an abstract layer over the metadata of any set of repositories that a maintainer might be responsible for. From ensuring labels have a consistent color scheme across a set of repositories, to making sure all licensing issues are dealt with, and over to proritizing issues across repositories.

Think if such a tool would even be able to manage to do all this not just across repostories and organizations, but also across hosting sites?
Thanks to all the hard work done in https://github.com/librariesio/ by @teabass and @benjam and all the contributors in the many ways that they have given to the project, we can make this a reality.

## Vision
To provide an api that can be the backbone for consuming/acting on the data in any way the maintainer might choose.
From a cli to mobile app, from Windows to OSX, we want everyone to be able to use what makes them feel comfortable.

## Thanks and Acknowledgments
- https://github.com/librariesio/ for being a source to enable such a project
- @teabass for the encourgment
- @shiftkey for being a rolemodel OSS maintainer

## Naming
Naming is hard, and when the idea of this project was first thought of, the plan was to name around the concept of a helper /aid. Since most (read all) names in that space where taken, some help had to be called in

//TODO `insert screenshot`
These names where chosen from a pool of options after extenssive research into synonyms and synonyms of synonyms.
[Donzel](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/donzel) will be the name of the api that powers it all, while [Myrmidon](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/myrmidon) will be the name of the overall organization and might be the name for the official GUI that is planned to be offered.
